	<brief_description>
		Base class to all voxel procedural generators. If you want to define a custom one with a script, this is the class you should extend from.
		Important: this engine makes heavy use of threads. Generators will run in one of them, so make sure you don't access the scene tree or other unsafe APIs from within a generator.

		<method name="generate_block">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="out_buffer" type="VoxelBuffer">
				Buffer into which the voxel values must be set. Its size also determines the size of the area.
			</argument>
			<argument index="1" name="origin_in_voxels" type="Vector3">
				Lower-corner of the area to generate. These coordinates are relative to the expected LOD and scale by powers of two. For example, LOD1 coordinates == LOD0 coordinates * 2.
			</argument>
			<argument index="2" name="lod" type="int">
				Which LOD the block is expected for. 0 means highest level of detail. 1 means half-resolution, 2 means quarter-resolution etc.
			</argument>
			<description>
				Generates a block of voxels within the specified world area.
